<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my account! Here are some quick, fun stuff about me: </p>
<p>I am making a game using C/C++</p>
<p>I am working on a graphics library that <b>does not use Vulkan, OpenGL, Metal, DirectX11/12 or any already existing graphics library.</b></p>
<p>I am working on my own web browser.</p>

## My Websites
I have had to delete the site, I am gonna redo everything in my website, currently I am finding it difficult to get it up and running becuase I removed the custom domain.
